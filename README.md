# Azure Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform

**This repository contains Terraform code to deploy a complete Azure infrastructure including networking, security, storage, and Kubernetes resources.**

Terraform Azure Infrastructure Overview:

- **🗂 Resource Group** – Base container for all Azure resources 
- **🌐 Virtual Network (VNet)** – Custom network with dedicated application and firewall subnets. 
- **🔒 Network Security Groups (NSGs)** – Controls inbound and outbound traffic for the subnets.
- **🔥 Azure Firewall** – Secures traffic within the VNet.
- **💾 Storage Account** – Provides persistent storage for applications and state data.
- **🔑 Service Principal** – Handles authentication for AKS and Key Vault.
- **🛡 Role Assignment** – Assigns the Contributor role to the Service Principal.
- **🔐 Key Vault** – Securely stores secrets and credentials.
- **☸️ AKS Cluster** – Deploys Azure Kubernetes Service for container workloads.
- **🖥 Local Kubeconfig Export** – Generates kubeconfig for kubectl access to the AKS cluster.


# Modules

**Resources were deployed individually in modules for code reusability**
